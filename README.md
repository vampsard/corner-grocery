"# corner-grocery" 
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is Made by connecting python and C++ in order to count the number of Times an item appears and depending on user choice it can be counting the number of each item a specific item or a specific item of the users choice or lastly take the number of each item and display them in a graph to show how they compare to one another
What did you do particularly well?
What I probably did best would be figuring out how to count all items and and display it on screen in a graph to compare to the other items
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would say the way I removed things from the list in the readfile portion of the code couldâ€™ve been dealt with more smoothly, so that I could remove the items and counted them in the same loop
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Probably readfile as it was the python code I had to make from scratch, and in python I was having a problem in that all errors in python would only be shown by going back and saying there was a problem in python but not showing what or where in python(still need to say how i overcame and what tools)
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the thing that is able to be transferred well to other projects would have to be the merging of C++ and python as it is something that many projects can benefit from having
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The obvious thing that helped me be able to keep the program readable would be keeping comments to tell what different parts of the code are used for and keeping the variable names relatively self explanatory
